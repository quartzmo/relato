    This is a very early version of an attempt to analyze open source
    projects' relationships, their relative importance and impact on each other.
    Right now only NPM is supported with four basic statistics, but we are
    planning to extend this to more interesting stats and different
    dependency management systems like Maven Central and PyPI.
  </p>

  <div class="stats-overview">
    <h2>NPM Project Statistics</h2>

    <p>
      The following data is based on NPM, the Node Package Manager. Node
      packages have a <code>package.json</code> file in which runtime and
      development dependencies can be defined. For every registered project
      on <a href="https://npmjs.org">npmjs.org</a>, the
      <code>package.json</code> file was downloaded and thereafter analyzed.
      Refer to the <em>Disclaimer</em> for some limitations of this approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment we are only providing four statistics.
    </p>
    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
      <dt>Users</dt>
      <dd>The total number of projects that depend on this package.</dd>

      <dt>Runtime Users</dt>
      <dd>
        The number of those projects who require this package in order to
        run. This number is based on the <code>package.json</code>
        <code>dependencies</code> property.
      </dd>

      <dt>Development Users</dt>
      <dd>
        All those projects that are listed under
        <code>devDependencies</code> fall into this category.
      </dd>

      <dt>Page Rank</dt>
      <dd>
        A value between 0 and 10 that represents the relative importance of
        NPM packages. A higher value means that a project is more important.
        The Page Rank is based on the total number of users,
        i.e. it does not differentiate between runtime and development
        dependencies.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <div id="npm-data">
    </div>

    <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>
      The presented data only captures dependencies and statistics of
      published NPM projects, i.e. frameworks and libraries. This means that
      you will not find any information about "normal projects", i.e. private
      or at least not published Node projects, e.g. web applications,
      which are only using open source projects, but that are
      never appearing as dependencies of other projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      A result of this limitation is that libraries and test frameworks
      have a high number of users and therefore high Page Rank, whereas
      other frameworks such as Express, that are mostly being used by
      for "normal projects", have a relatively low Page Rank. This becomes
      even more evident by the number of GitHub stars for Mocha (a test
      framework) and Express (web framework). Express has a vastly lower
      Page Rank, but has three times the amount of stars (~12k vs. 4k
      at the time of writing).
    </p>

    <h3>Future Work</h3>
    <p>
      While one can never take into account every NPM using project
      (which would need to include closed source software), it would be
      nice if the analysis included non published, but open source projects.
      Such data could be collected by crawling GitHub, BitBucket and other
      source code hosting sites. By doing so we could cope
      with the limitations mentioned in the disclaimer (to some degree).
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to this, the following topics are interesting.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        What are the most influential projects? Currently we are only
        providing one centrality measurement, i.e. Page Rank, but other
        measurements are interesting as well. We also want to provide different
        centrality measurements for different dependency types (runtime /
        development dependency).
      </li>
      <li>
        Who are the most influential open source contributors?
      </li>
      <li>
        What effect does a new release of an open source project have?
        <ul>
          <li>
            How many projects will immediately use a new version because of
            <a href="ttps://github.com/isaacs/node-semver">version ranges</a>?
          </li>
          <li>
            How long does it take until a new version is used?
          </li>
          <li>
            Are there any versions that have not been used at all?
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
